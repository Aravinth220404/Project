# SQL Practice
This repository contains my practice SQL scripts and queries as I learn and explore different concepts in SQL. The focus is on building a strong foundation for data querying, manipulation, and analysis.

## Contents
- **`basic_queries.sql`**: Simple queries to practice SELECT statements, filtering, and sorting.
- **`joins_and_relationships.sql`**: Examples of INNER JOIN, LEFT JOIN, RIGHT JOIN, and FULL OUTER JOIN to work with related tables.
- **`aggregations.sql`**: Queries demonstrating the use of aggregate functions like COUNT, SUM, AVG, MAX, and MIN.
- **`subqueries_and_ctes.sql`**: Practice with subqueries and Common Table Expressions (CTEs) for more complex data retrieval.
- **`data_manipulation.sql`**: Scripts for INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE, and managing data in tables.
